# What Should I Play?

WSIP is a Python-based tiny terminal utility that helps you stop dithering and start playing. It scans your local GOG Galaxy 2.0 library (GOG + integrated Steam/Epic) so you can filter, pick a mode, get a random smart suggestion, and launch the game to play.

---

## Features

* Reads your full Galaxy library (GOG + integrated platforms) directly from the **Galaxy DB**.
* Robust extraction of **title / genres / tags / rating / year / playtime** from multiple DB shapes.
* Multiple selection modes: roulette, “give me three”, mini-tournament, rating/playtime weighting, nostalgia, “opposite”, and **HLTB target time**.
* Optional **HowLongToBeat** lookups with a persistent cache to speed up repeats.
* Launches the selected game via **GalaxyClient.exe** (or Galaxy URI fallback).
* **Reroll** action re-runs the **same mode with the same parameters** (and current filters).

---

## Requirements

* **OS:** Windows (paths target common Windows Galaxy locations; other OSes may work for non-launch tasks if you point to a valid DB).
* **Python:** 3.8+ recommended.
* **GOG Galaxy 2.0** installed with a populated database.
* **Internet:** only needed for HowLongToBeat lookups.

### Python dependencies

Only one third-party package:

* [`howlongtobeatpy`](https://pypi.org/project/howlongtobeatpy/) — HLTB lookups (optional; script runs without it but HLTB mode is disabled).

Everything else uses Python’s standard library (`sqlite3`, `json`, `pathlib`, etc.).

## Installation

### 1) Install Python

On Windows, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check **“Add Python to PATH.”**

### 2) (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```powershell
# In the folder where you cloned/saved the script:
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell
# or (Command Prompt):
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 3) Install the dependency

```powershell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install howlongtobeatpy
```

> If you skip this, the script still runs, but the HLTB-based mode will be unavailable.

---

## Configuration

Open **`wsip.py`** and adjust these if needed.

### `DB_PATHS`

Paths where the script looks for the Galaxy DB file:

```
C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db
```

If your DB is elsewhere, add the full path to `DB_PATHS`.

### `GALAXY_EXE_CANDIDATES`

Candidate paths to `GalaxyClient.exe` (used by the **Launch** action):

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe
C:\Program Files\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe
```

Update if your Galaxy is installed somewhere else.

### Cache file

HLTB results are cached here (created automatically):

```
%APPDATA%\RandomGalaxy\hltb_cache.json
```

Delete this file to clear the cache.

---

## Running

From the folder containing the script:

```powershell
# If using the venv:
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the script:
py wsip.py
# or:
python wsip.py
```

On start, the script prints how many games it found. If `howlongtobeatpy` isn’t installed, it will say so (HLTB mode will be disabled).

## Using the app

### Filters

Press **`F`** to change filters (Enter keeps current values):

* **Platform:** `all` / `gog` / `steam` / `epic` / …
* **Genre:** substring match (e.g., `rpg`)
* **Tag:** substring match (e.g., `roguelike`)
* **Min rating:** number (works with 0–10 or 0–100 styles)
* **Install state:** `any` / `installed` / `not`

Press **`S`** to show current filters.

### Selection modes

After filtering, pick a mode:

* **Roulette** — random pick from the current matches.
* **Give me three** — shows 3 random games; choose `1/2/3` (or `r` to reroll the trio).
* **Mini tournament** — quick single-elimination bracket up to 8 games; you choose winners.
* **Weight by played hours** — favors games you’ve played **less** (good for backlog).
* **Weight by rating** — favors higher-rated games.
* **Nostalgia mode** — prompts for a **cutoff year**; prefers games released **on or before** that year.
* **Opposite filtering** — tries to pick something “different” (outside current set, leaning recent & lower-rated).
* **How Long To Beat** — prompts for a target HLTB **‘Main’ hours** and a comparison:

  * `1) More` — find a game **≥ target** hours
  * `2) Equal (default)` — find a game **near** target (±20%)
  * `3) Less` — find a game **≤ target** hours

  This mode samples the library in small random batches, resolves HLTB times (using cache), shows a **live progress bar**, and stops when it finds a match close to your target. If nothing matches before the timeout, it prints **“No game found within timeout.”**

> **Tip:** The HLTB cache grows over time, making lookups faster on reruns.

### After a game is picked (Actions)

* **`L` Launch** — starts the game via Galaxy (or falls back to `goggalaxy://` URI).
* **`R` Reroll** — re-runs the **same mode with the same parameters** (and current filters) to pick a new candidate without prompting again.
* **`C` Change filters** — returns to the filter prompt; after changing, the app attempts a reroll with the **same mode/params** under the new filters.
* **`M` Back to modes** — returns to the mode menu.
* **`Q` Quit** — exits.

## Troubleshooting

### “galaxy-2.0.db not found”

Update the `DB_PATHS` list in the script to point to your actual DB. Common default:

```
C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db
```

*(Hidden by default; you may need admin privileges or enable hidden items.)*

### “HowLongToBeat is not available …”

Install:

```powershell
pip install howlongtobeatpy
```

Without it, all modes work **except** the HLTB-based mode.

### Launch fails

Ensure `GALAXY_EXE_CANDIDATES` matches your install, or open the selected game once in Galaxy so the URI scheme works. The script attempts:

```
goggalaxy://openGame/<id>
```

if the EXE isn’t found.

### Slow HLTB lookups

First-time lookups can be slower. They’re cached at:

```
%APPDATA%\RandomGalaxy\hltb_cache.json
```

Repeated runs will be faster.

### Tiny match count

Loosen your filters (`F`) or switch selection modes.
